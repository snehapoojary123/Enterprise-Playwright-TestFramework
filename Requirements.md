Enterprise Test Automation Framework for AUT (Salesforce)

1. Overview
The enterprise test automation framework is designed to provide robust, scalable, and feature rich solution for automated testing of Salesforce application(AUT). The Framework encompasses various features like data driven testing, logging, rety mechanism, slef healing, cross browser testing, multiple environments, password encryption, code quality, CI/CD integration, reusable utilities, data generation, parallel testing and API mocking/tetsing.

2. Features
    2.1 Page Object Model (POM) Implementation
    . Objective: Apply POM principle to structure the code and make reusable & maintainable code.
    2.2 Data-Driven Testing
    . Objective: Enhance test coverage by parameterizing test with external data.
    2.3 Logging 
    . Objective: Provide comprehensive logs for detailed test execution analysis.
    2.4 Retry Mechanism
    . Objective: Handle intermittent failures gracefully with automatic retries.
    2.5 Self Healing
    . Objective: Adapt to dynamic changes in Salesforce application to minimize maintenance efforts.
    2.6 Cross Browser Testing
    . Objective: Validate Application functionality accross different browsers.
    2.7 Multiple Environments
    . Objective: Support testing in different environments e.g (Sandbox, Developer edition, Production).
    2.8 Password Encryption
    . Objective: Securly manage and use passwords in test scenarios.
    2.9 Code Quality
    . Objective: Enforce coding standards and maintain high quality code.
    2.10 CI/CD Integration
    . Objective: Seamlessly integrate the code with CI/CD pipelines.
    2.11 Reusable Utilities
    . Objective: Develop modular and reusable utilites to optimize code maintenance.
    2.12 Data generation
    . Objective: Generate data dynamically to ensure diverse test scenarios.
    2.13 Parallel Testing
    . Objective: Execute test concurrently to faster feedback and optamized test suit execution.
    2.14 API Mocking/Testing
    . Objective: Mock and test Salesforce APIs to validate backend functionality.

3. Test Scenarios (Sample)    
    3.1 Page Object Model Class and Basic Test

    Scenario: Verify creation of Page class for Login test and basic test
    Steps:
        1. Create POM class for Login Page 
        2. Create Tests using Page class and its methods to login
            . Login to Salesforce
            . Verify the scuccess of login
